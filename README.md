This project can show a wave form for a .wav file, and it can get the total samples and the hihgest value in the wave.
To run the program, simply clicking on "click here to load file" to load the .wav file, and it will also display the sound.
"Total number of samples" of the .wav file bases on the size of the original .wav file.
"Max value" depends on the high frequency of the wave form.
